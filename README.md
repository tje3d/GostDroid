## Recent Improvements

### Enhanced App List Management

- **Multiple Package Support**: The app list now supports multiple package names with an improved UI
- **Easy Management**: Tap on "App List" to open a dedicated dialog for managing apps
- **Add/Remove Apps**: Simple buttons to add new apps or remove selected ones
- **Common Apps Suggestions**: Quick access to popular apps like Chrome, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.
- **Better Summary**: Shows the number of selected apps and their names in the preference summary

### How to Use the New App List Feature

1. Enable "Per-app Proxy" in Advanced Settings
2. Tap on "App List" to open the management dialog
3. Use "Add App" to manually enter package names or select from common apps
4. Select apps from the list and use "Remove Selected" to remove them
5. Save your changes to apply the new app list

The app list still uses the same newline-separated format internally, ensuring compatibility with existing configurations.
